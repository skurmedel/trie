# trie

Implementations of a trie in various languages.

This project used to reside at [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/skurmedel/trie) but is now hosted here.

## Current status

Right now, there's just an implementation for Python. But it works quite well.

## License

See individual files for license, some files like the bundled dictionaries are not made by me and thus have other license requirements.

In general, the actual implementations themselves are under New BSD-style or MIT-licenses.
